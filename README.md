# Gene expansions contributing to human brain evolution

This repository contains all scripts and intermediate files for all the analyses included in *reference pending*.

The analyses were divided based on the sections of the manuscript as follows:

- Section I: Identification of human gene duplications in T2T-CHM13
- Section II: Connecting genetic variation of duplicated genes with neural traits
- Section III: Duplicated gene expression in the developing human brain
- Section IV: Modeling functions of duplicated genes in brain development
- Section V: Genetic variation of candidate genes important in neurodevelopment
- Section VI: Duplicated gene functions modeled using zebrafish
- Section VII: Novel human-specific genes impacting neurodevelopment

Each Section folder includes all scripts and files necesseary for running them. Raw sequencing files are found in ENA project *PRJEB82358*.
