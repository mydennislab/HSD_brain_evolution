# Tajima's D values

Genome-wide Tajima's D values calculated using unrelated 1000 Genomes Project individuals (n=2,504) from five continental ancestries.

Tajima's D values were calculated using `vcftools` using 25-kbp sliding windows.

Only regions with at least 5 SNPs and at least >50% accessible according to the short-read accessibility mask calculated for T2T-CHM13 (v1.0) genome.
